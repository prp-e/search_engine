# Search Engine Project

I always knew how search engines work, but I never tried to make one. In this prject, I will try my best to create an engine that can:

1. Crawl the web for information and links. 
2. Index the crawled material in a decent database.
3. Search through the indexed material and lists the best matches. 

For all those steps, I have plans. I haven't decided about the database I'll use yet, but I am almost sure how I'll perform search (funny, isn't it?) and about the crawler, I almost wrote the whole goddamn thing. 

## TODO 

- [ ] Find a suitable database for indexing crawled material.
- [ ] Connecting this thing to a database

## Technologies Used

* __Programming Language__: Python (Version 3.8 used, but there should be no problems for older or newer ones.)
* __Python Libraries__:
    * `bs4`: Something to crawl the web.
    * `requests`: Something to send requests and get the needed information.
